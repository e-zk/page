======
password manager using age (https://age-encryption.org/) for encryption.

encrypted secrets are files in the $PAGE_SECRETS/ directory that are encrypted
using the $PAGE_RECIPIENTS age public key.

when opening/editing an encrypted secret the file is decrypted usingj
$PAGE_PRIVKEY to a temporary file which is then opened in $EDITOR. after
closing the temporary file the secret in $PAGE_SECRETS/ is replaced with the
updated encrypted secret.

since secrets are just plaintext files you can store whatever you want in them:
passwords, notes, etc.
when using the `open' subcommand an entry's content is copied to the clipboard
excluding any lines that start with a '#'.

 building 
----------
to build use make:

$ make
$ make install

to install page do a different prefix:

$ make PREFIX=$SOME_PREFIX install

 usage 
-------
usage: page <command> [args]
where <command> can be any of:
* help  show help message
* ls    list password entries
* open  copy a password entry to the clipboard
* edit  create/edit an entry using $EDITOR
* rm    remove password entry

see `page <command> -h' to read the help message for a specific subcommand.

 environment
-------------
page's functionality can be configured via environment variables. the following
table lists environment variables and their defaults.

 env              | default                          
------------------|----------------------------------
 $PAGE_PRIVKEY    | $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/page/privkey    
 $PAGE_RECIPIENTS | $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/page/recipients 
 $PAGE_SECRETS    | $XDG_DATA_HOME/page/secrets/     

$PAGE_PRIVKEY holds a path to an age(1) private key.
$PAGE_RECIPIENTS contains the path to the associated age(1) public key.
$PAGE_SECRETS should point to a directory containing encrypted entries.

 key setup
-----------
in order to start using page you must first generate an age keypair
($PAGE_PRIVKEY and $PAGE_RECIPIENTS). this can be done by using the `init'
subcommand:

$ page init

alternatively, you can install the age encryption tool and use age-keygen:

$ age-keygen -o $PAGE_PRIVKEY
Public key: age1[...]

copy the public key into the $PAGE_RECIPIENTS file (without the newline).
it is also recommended to lock down the permissions of these files:

$ chmod 0600 $PAGE_PRIVKEY
$ chmod 0644 $PAGE_RECIPIENTS

 scripting
-----------
the contrib/ directory contains some scripts for working with page. feel free
to open a PR if you have a script using page that you'd like to share.
